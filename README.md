- `Snaplines [Numpad 1]` a red line will be drawn from local players view angle to other players's feet
- `2D Box [Numpad 2]` a green/red 2D box will be drawn around a firendly/enemy as a ESP feature so you can know where the players are (even behind walls)
- `Status bar [Numpad 3]` a green and blue bar will appear on sides of 2D box and represent health/armor status of a firendly/enemy
- `Status text [Numpad 4]` a status text will appear beneath player with player name
- `Recoil crosshair [Numpad 5]` a custom crosshair will appear on the screen, since game one follows recoil
- `Aimbot [Numpad 6]`
- `Triggerbot [Numpad 7]` shoot enemy automatically when he crosses crosshair
- `End` to eject a dll
